# Version Control System

- A version control system (VCS) is a program used to store a group of documents and also record changes that occur to those documents over time so that older versions can be recalled later. These documents are general and can be source files, images, word documents, etc. A collection of documents (typically related to each other) is stored in a repository for the VCS. One of today's most popular VCS's is Git and the GitHub repository, which you may find useful when working in teams in future CS courses (introduction to Git).

- See the VersionControl.html for more information.
